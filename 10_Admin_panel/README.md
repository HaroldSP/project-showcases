# Admin Panel

This repository (10_Admin_panel folder) showcases an Admin Panel application powered by JSON-Server and server-side queries. It offers functionalities such as user management including editing, deleting, and sorting based on attributes like having children or access privileges. The interface allows for searching user names, filtering users by those with children or access, and viewing all users. Due to GitHub Pages limitations, starting the JSON Server locally is necessary to experience its comprehensive features.

`npm init -y` or `npm init` to set up environment manually

`npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`

After that you can build a project:

`npm run build` or `npm start` to use webpack web server and have a live update

Install a json server `npm install -g json-server`

`npm run server` to start a json server

Check paths in package.json if something goes wrong.
