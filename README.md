## JS examples

1. [**01_Game_bot**](https://haroldsp.github.io/project-showcases/01_Game_bot/) - a small guess-a-number game in a browser.
2. [**02_To-Do-List**](https://haroldsp.github.io/project-showcases/02_To-Do-List/) - a simple To-Do-List demonstarting the work with localStorage.
3. [**03_Layout_Price_Calculator**](https://haroldsp.github.io/project-showcases/03_Layout_Price_Calculator/) - a straightforward layout price calculator showcasing fundamental concepts of modern JavaScript practices. This calculator supports two languages and stores user preferences in the localStorage. Given the project's small scale and the presence of only two languages, it employs a non-localization approach, resulting in duplicated content and functions. The original project with different branches representing step-by-step development can be found in this archived [repo](https://github.com/HaroldSP/JS_course).
4. [**04_Moving_square_with_key_arrows**](https://haroldsp.github.io/project-showcases/04_Moving_square_with_key_arrows) - a JS project that demonstrates OOP principles by creating a simple interactive application. The main focus of the project is a red square that can be moved on the screen using arrow keys. The project emphasizes the use of OOP concepts such as inheritance, prototypes, constructors, and classes to achieve the interactive behavior.
