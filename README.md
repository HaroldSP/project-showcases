   <details>
   <summary>–ê straightforward layout price calculator showcasing fundamental concepts of modern JavaScript practices.</summary>
   This calculator supports two languages and stores user preferences in the localStorage. Given the project's small scale and the presence of only two 
   languages, it employs a non-localization approach, resulting in duplicated content and functions. The original project with different branches representing step-by-step development can be found in this archived [repo] 
   (https://github.com/HaroldSP/JS_course).

5. [**05_Webclient_Entity_Manager**](https://haroldsp.github.io/project-showcases/05_Webclient_Entity_Manager)
   <details>
   <summary>A client-side web application for managing entities through a user interface.</summary>
   The application uses object-oriented principles, including inheritance, to define classes with various properties. Users can create entities by filling out a form with fields corresponding to the properties of the chosen 
   class. Upon saving, entities are created based on the selected subclass, stored in an array, and persisted in local storage. The entities are displayed in a table, and users can delete them, which removes them from the 
   array, local storage, and the table. The data is preserved across page refreshes.
