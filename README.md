# Various code & projects examples

All links lead to the https://haroldsp.github.io/project-showcases/ and than a listed folder.

So if you don't want to click on the link (like **01_Game_bot** etc.) you can click on the github-pages tab on the right, and than manually add the folder name to the adress line of your browser.

## JS examples

1. [**01_Game_bot**](https://haroldsp.github.io/project-showcases/01_Game_bot/) - a small guess-a-number game in a browser.
2. [**02_To-Do-List**](https://haroldsp.github.io/project-showcases/02_To-Do-List/) - a simple To-Do-List demonstarting the work with localStorage.
